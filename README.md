# Multi-Purpose Timer
A sleek timer that features 3 different counting modes for your working needs. All times can be adjusted to suit your personal tastes.

## Pomodoro Timer
This mode uses the Pomodoro method to cycle between working and break states. It follows the process of working for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break period. Repeat this 3 additional times and you finally earn a 15-minute break that follows the fourth 5-minute short break.

## Descend Timer
This frontloaded in work timer pushes you to work hard at the beginning, but gives you more leniency after each break. This is colloquially known as the 50:40:30:20:10 method. The methods involves a 50-minute work session followed by a 10-minute break. After each break, the work session decreases by 10 minutes. After finishing the last work and break sessions, the timer resets to the 50-minute work session.
