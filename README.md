# Multi-Purpose Timer
A sleek timer that features 3 different counting modes for your working needs. All times can be adjusted to suit your personal tastes.

## Pomodoro Timer
This mode uses the Pomodoro method to cycle between working and break states. It follows the process of working for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break period. Repeat this 3 additional times and you finally get a much longer 15-minute break that follows the fourth 5-minute short break.

## Descend Timer
This frontloaded in work timer pushes you to work hard at the beginning, but gives you more leniency after each break. This is typically called the 50:40:30:20:10 method, but that's a bit of a mouthful and not entirely accurate if you change the times. Essentially, you work for 50 minutes then take a 10-minute break. After this, you work for 40 minutes, followed by another 10-minute break. After the work time reaches the lowest value, it cycles back up to the longest work time.

## Standard Timer
This timer is just a regular timer in which you can modify the hours, minutes, and seconds.
